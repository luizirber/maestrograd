<h1>Why Adventure Games Suck</h1>
<h2>And What We Can Do About It</h2>
<h3>By Ron Gilbert</h3>

<p>
©1989, Ron Gilbert
</p>


<p>
Of all the different types of games, the ones I most enjoy playing are
adventure/story games.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no surprise that this is also
the genre for which I design.&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy games in which the
pace is slow and the reward is for thinking and figuring, rather than
quick reflexes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The element that brings adventure games to
life for me is the stories around which they are woven.&nbsp;&nbsp;When
done right, it is a form of storytelling that can be engrossing in a
way that only interaction can bring.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key here is &#8220;done
right&#8221;, which it seldom is.
</p>


<p>One of my pet peeves is the recent trend to call story games
&#8220;Interactive Movies.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are interactive, but they are not
movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that people want to call them movies just
points out how lost we are.&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do is to
establish a genre for our works that we can call our
own.&nbsp;&nbsp;Movies came from stage plays, but the references are
long lost and movies have come into their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same
thing needs to happen to story games.
</p>


<p>The desire to call them Interactive Movies comes from a couple of
places.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is Marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the goal of
narrow-minded marketing to place everything into a category so it will
be recognizable.&nbsp;&nbsp;These people feel that the closest things
to story games are movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other source for the name
Interactive Movie is what I call &#8220;Hollywood Envy.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great
number of people in this business secretly (and not so secretly) wish
they were making movies, not writing video games.&nbsp;&nbsp;Knock it
off!&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really want to make movies, then go to film
school and leave the game designing to people who want to make games.
</p>


<p>Story games are not movies, but the two forms do share a great
deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not fair to completely ignore
movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can learn a lot from them about telling stories
in a visual medium.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is important to realize that
there are many more differences than similarities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have
to choose what to borrow and what to discover for ourselves.
</p>


<p>The single biggest difference is interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&#8217;t
interact with a movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;You just sit in the theater and watch
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a story game, the player is given the freedom to
explore the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the player doesn&#8217;t always do what the
designer intended, and this causes problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to
create a cohesive plot when you have no idea what part of the story the
player will trip over next.&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem calls for a special
kind of storytelling, and we have just begun to scratch the surface of
this art form.
</p>


<p>There is a state of mind called &#8220;suspension of
disbelief.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are watching a movie, or reading a good
book, your mind falls into this state.&nbsp;&nbsp;It occurs when you
are pulled so completely into the story that you no longer realize you
are in a movie theater or sitting at your couch,
reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the story starts to drag, or the plots begins
to fall apart, the suspension of disbelief is lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;You soon
start looking around the theater, noticing the people in front of you
or the green exit sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;One way I judge a movie is by the
number of times I realized I was in a theater.
</p>


<p>The same is true of story games (as well as almost all other kinds
of games).&nbsp;&nbsp;As the story builds, we are pulled into the game
and leave the real world behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;As designers, our job is to
keep people in this state for as long as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every
time the player has to restore a saved game, or pound his head on the
desk in frustration, the suspension of disbelief is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;At
this time he is most likely to shut off the computer and go watch TV,
at which point we all have lost.
</p>


<p>I have created a set of rules of thumb that will minimize the loss
of suspension of disbelief.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with any set of rules, there
are always exceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my designs, I hope that if these
rules cannot be followed, it is for artistic reasons and not because I
am too lazy to do it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Maniac Mansion, in one place
or another, I violated all but one of these rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of
them were violated by design, others by sloppiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I
could redesign Maniac Mansion, all the violations would be removed and
I&#8217;d have a much better game.
</p>


<p>Some people say that following these rules makes the games too easy
to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree.&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes most games tough
to play is that the puzzles are arbitrary and
unconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most are solved by chance or repetitive
sessions of typing &#8220;light candle with match,&#8221; &#8220;light paper with match,&#8221;
&#8220;light rug with match,&#8221; until something happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not
tough game play, this is masturbation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I played one game
that required the player to drop a bubble gum wrapper in a room in
order to get a trap door to open (object names have been changed to
protect the guilty).&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the reasoning?&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is none.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s an advanced puzzle, I was told.
</p>


<br>
Here, then, are Gilbert&#8217;s Rules of Thumb:<br>
<br>

<h3>End objective needs to be clear</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s OK if the objective changes in mid-game, but at the beginning
the player should have a clear vision as to what he or she is trying to
accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more frustrating than wandering
around wondering what you should be doing and if what you have been
doing is going to get you anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;Situations where not
knowing what&#8217;s going on can be fun and an integral part of the game,
but this is rare and difficult to pull off.
</p>

<h3>Sub-goals need to be obvious</h3>

<p>Most good adventure games are broken up into many
sub-goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Letting the player know at least the first
sub-goal is essential in hooking them.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the main goal is
to rescue the prince, and the player is trapped on an island at the
beginning of the game, have another character in the story tell them
the first step: get off the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just good
storytelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Kenobi pretty much laid out Luke's whole
journey in the first twenty minutes of Star Wars.&nbsp;&nbsp;This
provided a way for the audience to follow the progress of the main
character.&nbsp;&nbsp;For someone not used to the repetitive
head-banging of adventure games, this simple clue can mean the
difference between finishing the game and giving up after the first
hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s very easy when designing to become blind to what
the player doesn&#8217;t know about your story.
</p>

<h3>Live and learn</h3>

<p>As a rule, adventure games should be able to be played from
beginning to end without &#8220;dying&#8221; or saving the game if the player is
very careful and very observant.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is bad design to put
puzzles and situations into a game that require a player to die in
order to learn what not to do next time.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say
that all death situations should be designed out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Danger is
inherent in drama, but danger should be survivable if the player is
clever.
</p>


<p>As an exercise, take one complete path through a story game and then
tell it to someone else, as if it were a standard story.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you find places where the main character could not have known a piece
of information that was used (the character who learned it died in a
previous game), then there is a hole in the plot.
</p>

<h3>Backwards Puzzles</h3>

<p>The backwards puzzle is probably the one thing that bugs me more
than anything else about adventure games.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have created my
share of them; and as with most design flaws, it&#8217;s easier to leave them
in than to redesign them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The backwards puzzle occurs when
the solution is found before the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, the
crevice should be found before the rope that allows the player to
descend.&nbsp;&nbsp;What this does in the player&#8217;s mind is set up a
challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows he need to get down the crevice, but
there is no route.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the player has a task in mind as he
continues to search.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a rope is spotted, a light goes on
in his head and the puzzle falls into place.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a player,
when the design works, there is nothing like that experience.
</p>

<h3>I forgot to pick it up</h3>

<p>This is really part of the backwards puzzle rule, but in the worst
way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Never require a player to pick up an item that is used
later in the game if she can&#8217;t go back and get it when it is
needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very frustrating to learn that a seemingly
insignificant object is needed, and the only way to get it is to start
over or go back to a saved game.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the player&#8217;s point of
view, there was no reason for picking it up in the first
place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some designers have actually defended this practice
by saying that, &#8220;adventure games players know to pick up
everything.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cop-out.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the jar of
water needs to be used on the spaceship and it can only be found on the
planet, create a use for it on the planet that guarantees it will be
picked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the time between the two uses is long enough,
you can be almost guaranteed that the player forgot she even had the
object.
</p>


<p>The other way around this problem is to give the player hints about
what she might need to pick up.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aliens on the planet
suggest that the player find water before returning to the ship, and
the player ignores this advice, then failure is her own fault.
</p>

<h3>Puzzles should advance the story</h3>

<p>There is nothing more frustrating than solving pointless puzzle
after pointless puzzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each puzzle solved should bring the
player closer to understanding the story and game.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should
be somewhat clear how solving this puzzle brings the player closer to
the immediate goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a waste of time and energy for the
designer and player if all the puzzle does is slow the progress of the
game.
</p>

<h3>Real time is bad drama</h3>

<p>One of the most important keys to drama is timing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone
who has designed a story game knows that the player rarely does
anything at the right time or in the right order.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we let
the game run on a clock that is independent from the player&#8217;s actions,
we are going to be guaranteed that few things will happen with dramatic
timing.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Indiana Jones rolled under the closing stone
door and grabbed his hat just in time, it sent a chill and a cheer
through everyone in the audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that scene had been
done in a standard adventure game, the player would have been killed
the first four times he tried to make it under the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
next six times the player would have been too late to grab the
hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this good drama?&nbsp;&nbsp;Not
likely.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is to use Hollywood time, not real
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the player some slack when doing time-based
puzzles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to watch for intent.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the player
is working towards the solution and almost ready to complete it,
wait.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait until the hat is grabbed, then slam the door
down.&nbsp;&nbsp;The player thinks he &#8220;just made it&#8221; and consequently a
much greater number of players get the rush and
excitement.&nbsp;&nbsp;When designing time puzzles I like to divide the
time into three categories.&nbsp;&nbsp;10% of the players will do the
puzzle so fast and efficiently that they will finish with time to
spare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 10% will take too much time and fail, which
leaves 80% of the people to brush through in the nick of time.
</p>

<h3>Incremental reward</h3>

<p>The player needs to know that she is achieving.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
fastest way to turn a player off is to let the game drag on with no
advancement.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially true for people who are
playing adventure games for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;In graphics
adventures the reward often comes in the form of seeing new areas of
the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;New graphics and characters are often all that is
needed to keep people playing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if we are trying
to tell a story, then revealing new plot elements and twists can be of
equal or greater value.
</p>

<h3>Arbitrary puzzles</h3>

<p>Puzzles and their solutions need to make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;They
don&#8217;t have to be obvious, just make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;The best reaction
after solving a tough puzzle should be, &#8220;Of course, why didn&#8217;t I think
of that sooner!&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst, and most often heard after being
told the solution is, &#8220;I never would have gotten that!&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the solution can only be reached by trial and error or plain luck, it&#8217;s
a bad puzzle.
</p>

<h3>Reward Intent</h3>

<p>The object of these games is to have fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure out what
the player is trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is what the game wants,
then help the player along and let it happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most
common place this fails is in playing a meta-game called &#8220;second guess
the parser.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an object on the screen that looks
like a box, but the parser is waiting for it to be called a mailbox,
the player is going to spend a lot of time trying to get the game to do
a task that should be transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;In parser-driven games,
the key is to have lots of synonyms for objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the game
is a graphics adventure, check proximity of the player&#8217;s
character.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the player is standing right next to
something, chances are they are trying to manipulate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you give the player the benefit of the doubt, the game will be right
more than wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, I don&#8217;t know how much time
I spent trying to tie a string on the end of a stick.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
finally gave up, not knowing if I was wording the sentence wrong or if
it was not part of the design.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out, I was
wording it wrong.
</p>

<h3>Unconnected events</h3>

<p>In order to pace events, some games lock out sections until certain
events have happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with this, it
is almost a necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem comes when the event that
opens the new section of the world is unconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the
designer wants to make sure that six objects have been picked up before
opening a secret door, make sure that there is a reason why those six
objects would affect the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a player has only picked
up five of the objects and is waiting for the door to open (or worse
yet, trying to find a way to open the door), the act of getting the
flashlight is not going to make any sense in relation to the door
opening.
</p>

<h3>Give the player options</h3>

<p>A lot of story games employ a technique that can best be described
as caging the player.&nbsp;&nbsp;This occurs when the player is
required to solve a small set of puzzles in order to advance to the
next section of the game, at which point she is presented with another
small set of puzzles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once these puzzles are solved, in a
seemingly endless series of cages, the player enters the next
section.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be particularly frustrating if the player
is unable to solve a particular puzzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas to explore
tend to be small, so the only activity is walking around trying to find
the one solution out.
</p>


<p>Try to imagine this type of puzzle as a cage the player is caught
in, and the only way out is to find the key.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the key is
found, the player finds herself in another cage.&nbsp;&nbsp;A better
way to approach designing this is to think of the player as outside the
cages, and the puzzles as locked up within.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this model,
the player has a lot more options about what to do next.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
can select from a wide variety of cages to open.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the
solution to one puzzle stumps her, she can go on to another, thus
increasing the amount of useful activity going on.
</p>


<p>Of course, you will want some puzzles that lock out areas of the
game, but the areas should be fairly large and interesting unto
themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;A good indicator of the cage syndrome is how
linear the game is.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plot follows a very strict line,
chances are the designer is caging the player along the
path.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s not easy to uncage a game, it requires some
careful attention to the plot as seen from players coming at the story
from different directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest way is to create
different interactions for a given situation depending on the order
encountered.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If I could change the world, there are a few things I would do, and
quite frankly none of them have anything to do with computers or
games.&nbsp;&nbsp;But since this article is about games&#8230;
</p>


<p>The first thing I&#8217;d do is get rid of save games.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there
have to be save games, I would use them only when it was time to quit
playing until the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Save games should not be a part
of game play.&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to sloppy design.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a
challenge, think about how you would design a game differently if there
were no save games.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ever have the pleasure of
watching a non-gameplayer playing an adventure game you will notice
they treat save game very differently then the experienced
user.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some start using it as a defense mechanism only after
being slapped in the face by the game a few times, the rest just stop
playing.
</p>


<p>The second thing I&#8217;d change would be the price.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
between forty and fifty dollars a game, people expect a lot of play for
their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;This rarely leads to huge, deep games, but
rather time-wasting puzzles and mazes.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the designer ever
thinks the game might be too short, he throws in another puzzle or
two.&nbsp;&nbsp;These also tend to be the worst thought-out and most
painful to solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could have my way, I&#8217;d design games
that were meant to be played in four to five hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
games would be of the same scope that I currently design, I&#8217;d just
remove the silly time-wasting puzzles and take the player for an
intense ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience they would leave with would be
much more entertaining and a lot less frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;The games
would still be challenging, but not at the expense of the players
patience.
</p>


<p>If any type of game is going to bridge the gap between games and
storytelling, it is most likely going to be adventure
games.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will become less puzzle solving and more story
telling, it is the blueprint the future will be made
from.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing we cannot forget is that we are here to
entertain, and for most people, entertainment does not consist of
nights and weekends filled with frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;The average
American spends most of the day failing at the office, the last thing
he wants to do is come home and fail while trying to relax and be
entertained.

<h3>Posted by Adam on Jul 21, 2004 twenty five to six pm</h3>
</div>

<div class="body">Very, very good essay! I have been trying to point
out the meaning of this essay to everyone I know who plays games. It's
sad to say that most video games and movies are trash because there is
no artistic value to them. Most games I see are almost always "clones"
of other games that are recieving massive attention. The same goes with
movies. People are trying to get something out of a movie. And when I
see movies such as "The Fast and the Furious" or "XXX" making the top
box office hits, it tells me that most Americans want the violence and
"outstanding visuals" from a movie and not the story or the meaning of
the film. But because there is no artistic value in almost any game or
movie these days, it's hard for anyone to find an inspirational film
that was well made, or buy a great game over a game that was quickly
slapped together.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If people want to start including
artistic value into games they can start by looking into a game before
they buy it. See if the game has a website that includes an overview by
the ceator. Or find out what was the creator's inspiration for the
game. Just by reading these you can see that the creator put a piece of
himself in the game and didn't make "just another shooter". <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully, if people do a little
research before buying a game, gamers will purchase the better, higher
quality game that they will remember for years to come instead of
purchasing the same old games that are easily forgotten.<br>

Absolutely true! I'm not a game designer myself, but I'm a novellist,
which is actually in some ways close to being a game designer. You've
got to put at least one thing in which is "you". So many novels and so
many games are just copies of each other. The problem is that that's
what people want. <br>The key is originality and freshness, and never, ever, setting
out to give people what they seem to want. This is why so many of the
early Lucas Arts games were so brilliant. I've played Maniac Mansion,
Monkey Island 1, 2 and 3, and Day of the Tentacle and I loved 'em, even
though they were ancient. If you asked me what Lucas Arts has made
recently, I couldn't tell you. All I can tell you is that a) they're
probably not half as good, and b) it's so hard to find old games these
days.
<br>At least one game designer out there still knows what's important. Good one, Ron!<br>

Ron, you rock! thanks for the killer blog!
<br>
<br>How do you prevent Backwards Puzzles from happening? Are there techniques?
<br>
<br>
<br>Is there some kind of technique people use to prevent this from
happening? Like some kind of state machine or something which controls
what's available /etc?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>I'm playing around with an adventure game design for fun, and it's
a big concern of mine...This happened to me in Grim Fandago (with the

Hey Ron...&nbsp;&nbsp;great article!
<br>
<br>i have to tell you, there are so many things that i agree with in
this blog, and ur right... games are definitely not the same
anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;i remember playing all those sierra point and click
adventures. they were great. but there is one obvious reason why. they
HAD to be interesting. The computers back then didn&#8217;t have the strength
of todays computers... so if i game is going to be made, the story
&amp; design is what has to keep the player hooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today
its way too easy to forget about the game design and story cause the
only thing that most companies focus on is the graphics
engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;id say that about 75% of the games made are a
complete waste of money... cause they are fun for about 15-30 mins.
after that they become very repetitive and boring.
<br>
<br>im currently working on the Myst 4 dev team... one of the only
remaining "adventure" games i think!&nbsp;&nbsp;Im sure a lot of you
here are prolly saying "ah what a crap game", and yes... its not the
most exciting game in the world... but one that it definitely does is
suck you into the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way it was designed was keeping
the original Myst fans in mind, but giving the new fans a little break
with next-to-impossible puzzles. So the charm of the game is still
there, but the play-through is much quicker.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing
is that it pretty much defies all of Ron's rules. But considering
todays games, it is completely original.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would consider it
a very mature version of sierra's classics.&nbsp;&nbsp;And believe me,
i was NOT a Myst fan before!! (still dont consider myself a fan, but i
do envy the work and beauty put into it!) I would love to see how a
game like this would turn out if Ron was the designer. i bet it would
have a lot more people into it. You should think about that Ron!! ;)
<br>
<br>anyway, i hope u guys dont think this is a Myst plug, cause its
not. I just really believe that there are not many games among than the
10 billions fps' out there that could still be considered an adventure
game.
<br>
<br>Great work Ron... i hope that we get to see another one of your creations in the future!

<div class="body">
Just recently I remembered how much I love adventure games. I played Peasant's Quest [<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/disk4of12.html">http://www.homestarrunner.com/disk4of12.html</a>] over at Homestarrunner [<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/">http://www.homestarrunner.com</a>]
and got a bite from the nostalgia gorilla. So I went in search of some
old games, remembering a few years back that companies often abandoned
their games so they could be made available online (at least with not
any immediate repercussions).
<br>
<br>Cascading through a few games I eventually made it at your doorstep through Just Adventure [<a href="http://www.justadventure.com/">http://www.justadventure.com</a>].
After playing Peasant's Quest I realized how seemingly (I haven't tried
it yet) easy it would be to write some pretty decent adventure games in
Flash. I'm really sort of enamored with the idea, and I'm starting to
read up on my Flash and get my Illustrator skills up to snuff (I'm a
coder by profession, so I'm not worrying too much).
<br>
<br>Over the course of playing the old games that I had never beaten
when I was younger, I had a lot of your truisms rolling around in my
head. Though I have another one to add, especially in these days where
graphics can be very spectacular.
<br>
<br>### Make Original (And Relevant) Puzzles ###
<br>
<br>Puzzles are often seem to be the same boring generic puzzles - but
with different graphics. The human mind is pretty impressive and I
never understoof why puzzles weren't any more original. But then again,
that goes back to the laziness involved. It's easier to just rehash old
shit and throw some pretty graphics; effectively buying a nice dress
for&nbsp;&nbsp;the ugliest girl in the world.
<br>
<br>I really intend to use the help of your rules to make some
(hopefully) interesting adventure games. It's nice to have them all
laid out conveniently. Unfortunately, I have so many pet projects that
I never know when I'll actually finish the damn thing.
<br>
<br>Thanks for the great article.

<br>I would just like to take the opposite side here, and say that

adventure?&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things called puzzles are really hunt for
the easter egg, and switch the inventory item around until something
happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Story telling will never be more than a way to add
interest to game play.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adventure games suck because story

<i>Adventure games suck because story telling became more important than game play and people play games to play</i>
<br>
<br>I am going to have to disagree with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adventure
games sucked because designers started putting in crappy puzzles that
had nothing to do with the story.
<br>
<br>Every major puzzle in an adventure game should support the story,
just like in a film where every scene supports the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>What happened at the end of the adventure game reign was that
designers just started throwing in any old puzzle to trip up the
player.&nbsp;&nbsp;It stopped being about solving problems to advance
the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;It became a battle with the game designer to try
and figure out what they were thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;The puzzles became
completely disconnected from the narrative.
<br>
<br>I think there are a lot of other reasons for the decline of adventure games, but of over reliance on story is not one of them.<br>

Most games these days require a good story to engage the players
interest. The idea that you have to do something in order to progress
in the story (be it beat up a bad guy, solve a puzzel, lead an army,
etc...) makes you want to play more. Well, with most people anyway.
<br>
<br>And it's kind of the whole point of adventure games. If you want
mindless fun, play Space Invaders (great game mind you, but mindless
fun none-the-less, unless you <i>really</i> take it seriously). But
most people like there to be something deeper, something worth playing
for. Some people, don't. But adventure games are basically stories with
restictions, tales that need your interaction in order to move on. <br>
<br>The reason the puzzels need to be related to the story is so the
player feels that they're doing something to help the story along and
to help our hero. Otherwise, the puzzels are just plain redundant. They
might as well take a step, and then suddenly a puzzel appears on screen
for you to solve before you take another step. That's called annoying
bordome.<br>

3 points: the story, the evolutive life of the media and the designers mistakes.
<br>
<br>I think the major point for the decease of the adventure is the
story. or the plot. Telling stories is the most ancient thing the
humans do from the beginning of time (probably much of them were about
their sexual life). <br>
<br>it's strange that in our lives the sexual part must be "under the
carpet", something like secret, not clear. Maybe some influences by the
various religions.
<br>
<br>if the adventure was born like a baby, (our new method of telling
stories), he (it) dead before the sexual maturity, that comes around
the end of the puberty and the major age.
<br>
<br>i do not want to write the story of the adventure, that you may
know better than me, but there is a clear point where the life of the
adventure splits in two different styles. <br>the maniacmansion like almost dead because the lack of stories:
<br>
<br>_In this times there is a lack of people that can find interesting*
stories, and a lack of people who still knows the beauty of hearing a
story. Our language is moving fast, and telling a story is not just
telling a story, it's following the markets trends too. And following
the market is the first thing that an artist should avoid (i think that
aren't really rules for an artist, but he would tell somethin about the
man, maybe something new, or something old under a new point of view).
<br>
<br>* you and old murray said that the lack of this interest is about
too many unusefull puzzles; this point is about the meaning of the
things we see on the screen. You said that a puzzle must be coherent
with the story telling of the game, but probably this point that you
have clear in mind is missing to others designers (maybe this is why we
remember you with love, many years after you did yours creations)._
<br>
<br>The other type of adventure is built around the sexual-mature
theme, most of the work is done in japan, in anime, hentai adventures
that have just one power point: the sex; <br>The most time passes by, the more sexy adventures get's their
personal story, less or more elaborated (probably because too free
virtual sex gets boring).
<br>
<br>All this writing to tell that if some one wants to make a new great
adventure he must consider that he's using an hybrid media, that still
needs to get old and evolve; he must have something nice to tell to the
world and he must follow Ron's rules.

Oh, the <b>secret</b> of Monkey Island is that life
is like a circus. You imagine that life is fun and exciting, when
really you're just stuck in a room full of freaks ;-)
<br>
<br>Hope that satisfies your curiosity... On the other hand, I could just be making the whole thing up! ;-)<br>

This is a reply to Roger, who wanted good puzzles and didn't care about the story.
<br>
<br>I agree with those who think the story is important. For me the
puzzles are really secondary. They should only exist as the means of
connecting me to the action. This is why I regard a game like KOTOR as
being essentially an adventure game, even though it has RPG-inspired
combat rather than inventory puzzles and insult fights. When I played
KOTOR, I was sucked deep into the story. When I had to stop, I couldn't
wait to get back to it and find out more: visit another planet, get
involved in another subplot, meet another character. Similarly, I
enjoyed GK3 not only because of the outstanding puzzle-design, but
because the characters were all interesting and I really, really wanted
to know what was going on with each of them. I mean, you could hardly
get me off the computer for meals.
<br>
<br>Puzzle-oriented games are fine for those who prefer them; in fact
you're likely to get much more logical puzzles in this kind of game
(one with loads of puzzles, but a thin story) than in an adventure
game. For people who just like to work on a puzzle for a while, a story
doesn't matter much. But for me, although I do want something to do
(choices to make, paths to explore) having to spend a great deal of
time on a puzzle isn't pleasant, unless the puzzle itself fits into the
story of the game. I like it best when the game's characters give you
little hints and nudges, because it makes me feel like I'm part of the
game world and not outside it.
<br>
<br>Nothing disappoints me more than to solve a bunch of puzzles and
then find out that the puzzles themselves were supposed to be the sole
gratification. I want a good story and a good ending. This gives me a
reason to finish the game. I've played a few games lately where the
ending just sucked and I thought, That's it? All that effort, for that?
For me, be it a shooter, RPG, RTS, whatever, it ought to have a fair
story behind it. That's the main thing I want out of most games,
because it links the gameplay elements together. In fact, I wouldn't be
a gamer or even much of a computer user at all if it weren't for text
adventures, which got me hooked long ago.<br>

I have to agree puzzles ARE secondary, not unimportant be any means but
definately secondary. I'm sure many of the people who post here have
played and then a few years later RE-played their favourite adventure
games, not for the joy of puzzle solving but to revel in the story and
to play with the multi linearity of the game by solving sub objectives
in a different order than previous times - probing the limits of the
game world and more often than not if the game is a good one finding
new and exciting results. <br>For example while playing Grim Fandango i had recieved a slip of
paper with the picture of a Rusty Anchor'&nbsp;&nbsp;the correct use of
this paper came to me quickly and i showed it to the correct character
to progress with that particular puzzle sequence, but while replaying
the game i showed it to EVERYONE i could and was rewarded with a small
history of the town of Rubacava, pesonal tales, a pretty cool song from
Glottis, and only the occasional refusal to do so from Manny. All of
these wonderfull discoveries continued to add glorious detail and depth
game world, the second time around.
<br>
<br>In fact i may say that in some cases i have received more joy
REplaying good adventure games, than playing for the first time. For me
the joy of probing and testing the setting, story, and characters is
more than that of the solving of puzzles and the inevitable frustration
involved (E.g. when you couldn't solve that tumbler lock puzzle in
Dominos island base- shudder)<br>

Thanks for the article, Ron.&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who has played
computer games right from the time of Loom, through the 'classic' era
of Lucasarts Adventure Games, the Kings Quest and Monkey Island and
Space Quest series of games, the text-adventure Zork's and King
Arthur's, I can really empathise with what you are saying in this
article.
<br>
<br>One thing that I do see starting to appear now in the computer
gaming insdustry is something called 'emergent gaming', where things
happen based upon the players actions, resulting in a story that is
different each time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's immensely hard to do, and can give
some rubbish gameplay if it fails, but when it is implemented correctly
I can see it being the renaisence of the Adventure Game.
<br>
<br>Take an example: Elite.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was such a small
system that was running it, there was no way to make it a true
adventure game, it was a space-flight-trade game, with a few 'emergent'
features.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was done now, due to the advanced
capabilities of modern computers, there is no doubt that it would have
a much greater story - a story that would not need to be forced on the
player, but one that would be created based upon the players actions.
<br>
<br>This can be seen in games like Deus Ex, which though being a
shoot-em-up cum RPG cum sneak'em'up, has semi-emergent features; you
don't have to shoot that guy, you can sneak past him, but if you do,
he's going to be there when you get into the next bit later...
<br>
<br>Imagine this in an adventure game context: The plot elements are
there, and things you do will cause other things to happen that the
author of the adventure has pre-scripted, but you can get to those
events at any time; and you can influence them based upon what you have
already done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adaptive gaming, if you like.
<br>
<br>If this comes in to play, and I can sort of see it starting to take
a hold in the game-developers mentalities, I can see Adventure Gaming
coming back, through the back-door, if you like; not called 'Adventure
Gaming', but as something else, emergent gaming, or something along
those lines, in a whole new genre...
<br>
<br>Maybe Adventure Games are dead... or maybe they just went away for a while, and will be back in another disguise...
<br>
<br>... as long as they don't need to use sticky tape on a cat to get the moustache!<br>

Hey Ron.
<br>I'm still waiting for the new revised version of your adventure game making rules of thumb.
<br>I'd also like to hear your opinions regarding how to bring back
from the dead adventure games in our time. A few of them are coming
out, like Syberia, but most often are really crappy....
<br>
<br>Is the target adventure gamer nowadays is still the same adventure gamer he was 15 years ago ? 
<br>What about those non-gamers that cam still become adventure games ?
<br>
<br>I'm not arguing about weather the genere is dead. I'm arguing about weather you can revive it.

I realize this topic is rather old and that few people and probably not Ron will read this.. But still.
<br>
<br>I've recently played some adventure games and there are some things that also need to be avoided.
<br>
<br>For the 1st I'll take an example from MI! The gathering of the fish
on the plank with the sea-gull... That annoyed a friend of mine to no
end. Now I can't remember if it annoyed me originally but I can see his
point. Having to walk to a spot that isn't remarkable in any way in
order to lift the plank just isn't obvious. If Guybrush could see the
plank and maybe note that it's lose then that'd had helped matters. As
it is it's too obscure.
<br>
<br>Another example of things to be avoided is from eh.. another game.
I walked around for an hour or so trying to find out what to do next..
Randomly trying everything with everything in pure frustration.. Only
to FINALLY find out.. That if in one screen... You walked all the way
to the right.. It would SCROLL! Thus revealing a new area and the
solution to my predicament.. Stuff like that is just annoying... If I
really was that character I'd be able to see the entire room and not
suddenly say.. Wow.. This room is bigger than I thought.
<br>
<br>The 3rd and last thing I've recently found annoying is when what
you think is the obvious solution for a puzzle.. Isn't relevant at all.
Let me elaborate. In a recent game I came upon a key marked shed or
something.. Naturally I picked the key up expecting it to unlock
something at some point. However shortly after, said key is stolen by
another character. Okay. Later on I come across... A locked shed!
"Aha!" I almost utter.. and run back to the thieving character trying
somehow to convince him to giving me the key he stole. After trying
pretty much everything... I give up. Later on I of course find out the
solution after once again having tried everything with the thieving
character for the 4th time or so... In desperation I walk down to the
shed.. and then it turns out you just have to break it open with a
crowbar... Of course that solution is obvious.. Or would have been had
there never been a key in the first place. Maybe it's just me that's
daft but I found it very annoying.<br>

Hell yes the adventure genre will be revived. It might take one year
for one amazing game to be released, or it might take many, but it will
be revived. I hope to help in this cause as much as I can. I want to
revive the adventure game genre and I am working on a Doom3 mod,
recreating Space Quest with the goals of making adventure games more
approachable. Even before reading Ron's excellent article I realized
that Space Quest offered frustrating gaming experiences that would not
be accepted by today's gamers. I have made changes to the plot and
gameplay to improve the game from a design standpoint. In my work I
think I've come up with a guideline that will help adventure games
regain popularity, much of that is echoed by Ron's words.
<br>
<br>1. Create great stories
<br>Great stories include likable and hated characters the player can
relate to on one level or another. A lot of popular adventure games
have wonderful characters.
<br>
<br>Creating a great story also includes an interesting world that
grabs the player and never lets go. The world should exist in "reality"
and the player just happens to be there, rather than the world created
for the player.
<br>
<br>2. Everything must serve a purpose for the plot development and/or
character narrative. This means all art content, writing and
gameplay(puzzles). It will help solidify the experience and lessen the
frustration that occurs from confusion or lack of understanding.
<br>
<br>3. Clean, intuitive interfaces are a must if the gamer is going to
feel comfortable exploring the game world and becoming a part of it. I
think Monkey Island three has a very clean yet not very intuitive
interface. I stumbled around for 10 minutes banging keys on my keyboard
until I read the manual.
<br>
<br>4. State of the art presentation. Lets be realistic here. Today's
gamers expect stunning graphics that draw them into the world. I don't
mean ultra "real world" realistic but a certain level of quality and
presentation needs to be achieved. I've played Syberia II and it's a
graphically pretty game, but the overall static backdrops and low poly
characters display a jarring disconnect that takes me out of the game.
Seeing Monkey Island in a first person perspective with top notch
artistic quality (cartoon or similar) would be amazing.

<div class="body">Hi! I stumbled upon this page for one particular
reason: I just completed Maniac Mansion. Yesterday. For the first time
in my life. <br>
<br>I realize that I am a little bit late in accomplishing that. But
although I was (and still am) a really big adventure fan, and although
I have played and completed almost all the classics, I have never been
able to finish Maniac Mansion the first time I tried, back in the
eighties. The reason? Basically Ron violating one of his own rules ...
:)
<br>
<br>Back then, I had actually spent quite some time playing MM on the
Atari ST. The reason I abandoned it for good was when I got stuck and
then found out (from a walkthrough) that I was supposed to give the
pepsi can to the man-eating plant&nbsp;&nbsp;- when actually I had
given it to the Green Tentacle WAAAAAY before, and there was no
savegame left.&nbsp;&nbsp;This threw me so off that I stopped playing
and never touched the game again - until last week, probably fifteen
years later. And this time, I enjoyed it a lot!
<br>
<br>The reason why I am posting this: I really love Ron's above
statements on the timing of drama events and that the player should be
able to complete time puzzles "just in time". Well, do you remember the
grand finale of Maniac Mansion? When Dr. Freds sets the
self-destruction mechanism and you have exactly two REAL TIME minutes
to find a way to work it out?
<br>
<br>I came into that situation wholly unprepared yesterday. I swear I
hadn't looked into any walkthrough guide for this beforehand (I wanted
to keep the "suspension of disbelief"), and I also hadn't tried it
before. So this situation was completely new to me, and I was racing to
find out what to do (and there are LOTS of things to do!) <br>
<br>And you know what?&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to find the solution and complete the game -- with THREE ... SECONDS ... LEFT.
<br>
<br>I have never had such a Hollywood style finishing in an adventure
game before. This more than compensated me for my first time failure in
the eighties. My heart is still pounding today. Thank you, Ron.<br>

Well I'm fairly sure that very few people will read this, but it's
mostly a message for Ron. I think that games with real storylines are
the absolute best. In fact, I have played all 4 Monkey Island games
repeatedly just to enjoy the story and the humor, even though I know
how to solve all the puzzles. One of my favorite aspects of the MI
games is that you always either have the item you need or you can get
it to solve a puzzle. I wish more people would make games like Monkey
Island. Maybe if I had enough money, I would have sent you a car for
Christmas. =)<br>

I don't find Out of this world that difficult or unforgiving. When I
first played it I finished it in 9 days, and I was younger than a
teenager, I never finished any Mario without cheating, and I never
finished Prince of Persia 2 (now THIS is a difficult game). Out of this
world has a sweet learning curve and lots of deaths, yes, but those
deaths increase tension in the game to make it the best cinematic
experience in a videogame. Apart from it, it's a game which tells you a
lot of things without a line of dialogue, including dramatic tension.
The "coliseum puzzle" does NOT depend on a strict order of pushing,
and, like Flashback, Black Thorne or Prince of Persia, is just one of
those great platformers which you enjoy when you learn all the
movements. Period.<br>

Hello.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been playing Psychonauts for the past few days
and although it's not a pure graphic adventure it does have a lot of
the elements that I find appealing in adventure games.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>When I was seven I lived down the block from the other nerdiest kid
in my school.&nbsp;&nbsp;We joined a book club, read comics and played
a lot of Lucasarts Adventure games, especially Monkey Island, which we
played over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp;These worlds were fully realized and
were far better escapist fantasy than Super Mario
Brothers.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's something dreamlike about the
games.&nbsp;&nbsp;The simulated environments of adventure games are
much like the nes in Disneylands dark rides.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensation
is like moving through a very involved and sometimes scary
dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I entirely agree that videogames shouldn't be a second job and it's
something I'e said for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could never get into
playing Dungeons and Dragons or Final Fantasy because who wants to work
to relax?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I hope that this type of videogame will regain
popularity.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't gauge how many people are aware of the
genre but I remember when my popular little sister accidentally playing
the Curse of Monkey Island with her friends and got absorbed by
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a genre that's accesible to people who see
videogames as work and don't care about the nameless characters racing
around a track, shooting each other or whatevers.
<br>
<br>You made going to school easier.

Ron, that article was quite well written and I agree with quite a bit
of it. I think that it should be mandatory reading for anyone who
decides to be a game designer. Games need to be fun, and I think that
is something that is lacking these days. People are focusing now on
making games look realistic and making physics in the game true to
life, but after all these new and great things that you add to the game
is it still fun to play? Monkey Island 1 and 2 were wonderful games,
and I salute you for making such great games. They achieved the effect
you were going for in that they would grab you and pull you into their
world, and make it where you would not want to leave. Games today just
don't have that, ((except WoW, but that's a compulsion, heh)) and it is
very tragic. I wish there were more adventure games today, but ones
like the ones you designed. I loved playing the Monkey Island games
because I feel as though they stimulated thought instead of just
frantic button-mashing. I totally agree with your statement about work
and relaxation as well... After tireless hours of working; the last
thing I want is to get frustrated because I can not complete a level or
whatever when I am trying to relax and unwind. This has an adverse
effect and makes playing games no different than work. Playing games
should be fun and enjoyable. I'm not saying that they need to make
games easier or anything because that wouldn't make them anymore fun,
but rather change the scope of the game and work on making the player
enjoy what he is doing. Guybrush Threepwood was a great character
because even though he was so clueless; he was a good funny guy that
you could not help but to like. I loved watching his mishaps over and
over; and loved anticipating what crazy thing he would do next. There
aren't characters like him anymore. It is very sad that colorful
characters and deep storylines are on the endangered list. I can only
hope that more people are able to read your essay, get inspired, and
wake up! These are some nice guidlines to go by, and several titles
today could benefit from them.<br>

Hello Ron. Thanks for a very interesting read. 
<br>I have several questions though - were you engaged in the development of the <b>Dig</b>?
Did anyone use these guide back then? It was a really great game with a
superb story and all, but the puzzles were so hard and at times
pointless. <br>
<br>Additionally, what do you think of the <b>"Hint"</b> system, that was at some point used in Sierra quests?<br>

I think adventure games have provided me with the most entertainment
value overall, particularly in my childhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I played
Police Quest III I really stepped into the character's
shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really took on his emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I
played more light hearted games like Monkey Island I really had a lot
of fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the main reason for that was the high quality
stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a bit like watching a movie but where you can
do this things at your own pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where instead of watching
an actor you actually become an actor.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the main
difference in the two mediums I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;With movies you
'watch', but with games you 'do'. <br>
<br>Unfortuantely, I don't really have an interest in adventure games
these days.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, with Syberia there is not much of a
cool factor for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see the fun in playing around
with these old robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I want a game that follows Ron's rules, where the story flows, and
the puzzles don't really seem like puzzles at all, but acts of common
sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want a game with a cool factor to
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to play a cop with a gun again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a
detective that has to solve some dark crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the
adventure game that will potentially give rebirth to the genre needs to
be really gritty and violent.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, once everyone's
attention has been gained, start giving them the more fluffy stuff our
imaginations have to offer.<br>

One of the worst design mistakes in The Longest Journey is this. WARNING: May contain spoilers!
<br>
<br>In order to proceed through a certain area you need a pizza
box.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find this box in a bin.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bad
thing about it is that you have to wait for someone to put it in the
bin.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this happens only once you have given a character,
in a location far away, a completely unrelated item to the puzzle at
hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>What the designers should of done is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you
visit the character far away before, which you have to do in order to
gain access to the area with the bin, you should be prevented from
leaving him until you have given him what must be given to
him.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you try to walk out your character
can stop and say 'I feel like I've forgotten to do something very
important here'.&nbsp;&nbsp;This still may be a bit lame but it is much
better than what was done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, it probably wouldn't
have been so lame because of the story.<br>

Adventure games are by far the best and i agree with all the good
points of your artical. unfortunatly most games, for a while now, have
very little new content beyond improved grafix and sound. I have left
most games for the the more intresting game play of the tried and true
old paper and pencil rpg. If you can get a few people together almost
any story can be all of the above and far more.<br>

We should all get writing, planning, story boarding - 
<br>
<br>check out 'Out from Boneville' by Tale tale games, i'm not
suggesting that it is a perfect example of an adventure - but they
produce episodic, downloadable games that are entirely self published
(i think). <br>
<br>The first section is released, and then some months later the next
one is ,and so on. people can follow a game like they would a series of
books or television dramas - people then buy whole series box sets of
dramas they like - surely the same could be done with these episodic
games- (this product resembling a complete game.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>A smaller individual product, that is easily distributed; less money involved and less RISK involved. 
<br>
<br>WE should do this. WE should get as much good stuff out there as we
can- we have the intent and knowledge - forget cutting edge graphics,
remember design. We should start a movement&nbsp;&nbsp;get noticed and
maybe like podcasting or bloggs perhaps some
corperate-suit-wearing-waste-of-semen will try and get on this
particular band wagon and put money and advertising into it who knows?
perhaps we need to simply proove that there is a market. <br>
<br>It's no perfect approach, i personally doubt that there ever is
one, ideals are easily traded in for other tempted rewards - but we
need to jump start this genre the only wasy we really can - by doing it
our selves. Anyway im probably being angry and rude now so i'll just
make this apeall - let's all just be pro-active about this, and design
some adventure games. <br>What do you intelligent people (and i dare say more experienced too)&nbsp;&nbsp;think?<br>

Hi Ron Gilbert... I'm a fan from denmark.
<br>
<br>An old friend of mine and I just re-completed MI this weekend. It's
still a lot of fun. A few weeks earlier I tried a somewhat new game,
Farcry, which had a lousy story... After playing the game for a few
hours I left it on the shelf. it got boring.
<br>
<br>with the game experiences in mind and having read the posts on this
site I get a feeling that we're being had. That computer- and game
companies are in on a conspiracy thing. <br>
<br>If the stories were the most important issue in games, it wouldn't
be neccesary to improve and upgrade your computer every six months,
whereas the games' graphics and cpu bit wouldn't have to become
gradually more and more demanding. <br>However, as the gameplay and graphics part is what people seem to
want constantly improved we are stuck with repetitive and boring, but
astonishing and almost real life, games.
<br>So at some point the companies decided that "Hey!, we're gonna
give them lousy stories and irrelevant puzzles and we're gonna get
rich." <br>
<br>If the games that are being produced keep demanding more hardware
and cpu power and stuff, the computer companies will sell more of it..
<br>
<br>We do get powerful computers, astonishing graphics and almost
real-life fps', and hurra(?) for that... But what about the whole lot
of people like my old friend and myself who love being absorbed into a
good story like the one in MI? We're being had, thats what we are!
<br>
<br>What I don't get is why the game companies don't do something about
it. I know a lot of people who would love to see some more adventure
games... if it's all about the money then I don't see why it shouldn't
be possible to release new adventure games... Why? Are we too few,
anyway?<br>

Hello Ron,
<br>
<br>I was reading this article of yours... and I thought: "What if
there would be things like FP- adventures?" Imagine I walk around,
first person, in a Monkey Island world and when I hit objects and I can
"push", "pull" them etc. FPS is just cool grahphics but story behind is
usually poor. If FPS can render graphics so well, why use them just for
running around in an alien planet world.
<br>
<br>Just an idea.
<br>
<br>Bye from Italy

<div class="body">simply put, adventure games are not as profitable as
fps and character building games. first person
shooters&nbsp;&nbsp;allways advance with technology and we see an
endless suplly of new ones. one for every new advance, including
graphics, sound and any gameplay gimmics the proggrammers can think of.
but when it comes down to it fps is point-shoot-move.
<br>character building games are more profitable in time spent playing.
<br>it takes time and resourses to create and original story and turn
it into an adventure. much more independent effort is required in
comparison and with less potential for long term profits.<br>

I agree that commercailly adventure gaming is dead, but what about the
indie community? There are plenty of guys producing Adventure games in
their spare time (<a href="http://www.pinheadgames.com/">http://www.pinheadgames.com</a> , <a href="http://www.johngreenart.com/nearlydeparted">http://www.johngreenart.com/nearlydeparted</a> , <a href="http://www.adventuredevelopers.com/index.php">http://www.adventuredevelopers.com/index.php</a>)
which are heavily influenced and inspired by the work of Ron Gilbert,
Tim Schafer, etc, and which are actually a very high standard, and
really fun to play. They're just a little shorter than the old
commercially-made games.<br>
